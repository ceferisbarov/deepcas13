# DeepCas13 #

A deep learning model to predict the sgRNA on-target activity with high accuracy from sgRNA sequences and RNA secondary structures.

DeepCas13 is developed by [Wei Li Lab](https://weililab.org/) at Children's National Medical Center, which is a deep learningâ€“based computational model for predicting the Cas13 sgRNA on-target efficiency.

DeepCas13 uses convolutional neural network (CNN) and following recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract spatial-temporal features for both sequence and secondary structure of one specific sgRNA and then predicts the efficiency by a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
