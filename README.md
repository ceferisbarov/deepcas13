# DeepCas13 #

A deep learning model to predict the CRISPR-Cas13d sgRNA on-target activity with high accuracy from sgRNA sequences and RNA secondary structures.

DeepCas13 uses convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) to extract spatial-temporal features for both sequence and secondary structure of a specific sgRNA and then predicts the efficiency by a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
